    <p>HTML provides several text formatting tags to style, emphasize, and highlight parts of a webpage’s content. The b tag makes text bold, while the strong tag also makes text bold but adds importance to the meaning. The i tag displays text in italic, and the em tag also italicizes text but emphasizes its meaning. The u tag underlines text, whereas the mark tag highlights text with a yellow background to draw attention. The small tag displays text in a smaller size, often used for fine print. The del tag shows deleted or outdated text with a strike-through line, and the ins tag is used to show newly added text, usually underlined. For scientific and mathematical notations, the sup tag is used for superscript text like H2O and the sub tag for subscript text like CO2. The blockquote tag is used for long quotations, while the q tag is for short inline quotes. The abbr tag defines abbreviations and acronyms, providing the full form when hovered over, such as abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" HTML. Lastly, the code tag is used to display programming code or technical text in a monospace font. Together, these tags make HTML content more readable, structured, and meaningful to both users and search engines.</p>
